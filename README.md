# tw-map-cli

Displays a given Teeworlds / DDNet map in the command line for viewing. Still heavy work-in-progress

Only use this if you have access to a command line exclusively, as there are many other better tools for the job ^^

## How to:
1. Install the pip package
2. `twview --map <map>``
3. `c` to exit

## Setup

Work-in-progress

## Bugs/Todo
- support display of more tiles
- clean up code, refactor out color definitions, etc.
- Better quit functionality
- Better error handling, automatic window sizing
